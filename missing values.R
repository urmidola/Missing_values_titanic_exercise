Exercise

2: Age
#You'll notice that a lot of the values in the Age column are missing. While there are many ways to fill these missing values, using the mean or median of the rest of the values is quite common in such cases.
#1.	Calculate the mean of the Age column and use that value to populate the missing values
#2.	Think about other ways you could have populated the missing values in the age column. Why would you pick any of those over the mean (or not)?

#Answer:  I would prefer mean imputation to populate the missing values because any other measure might cause worse bias. 


4: Cabin
#You notice that many passengers don't have a cabin number associated with them.
#.	Does it make sense to fill missing cabin numbers with a value?
#.	What does a missing value here mean?

#Answer:  It does not make any sense to fill missing cabin numbers with a value because there is no way that we can know which cabin numbers these people were assigned to. Moreover there are some survivors along with some non-survivors whose cabin numbers are missing.
#A missing value here does not give any indication to track the survival of the passengers as many passengers who do not have any cabon numbers, made it to the boat. The missing values just indicate that they were not recorded during that time.
